Upon entering this text file, download the whole assignment1 folder. After downloading, run assignment1.sln and run the program. A basic menu should be running with all the features required in the assignment. To access the cpp and header file, click on both assignment1 folders to view the other files. The text.txt file inside assignment1 file may be modified to any number up to 10 lines (since I haven't tested beyond the requested number of 10). Everything should work wonders. There are also screenshots of the program working.
